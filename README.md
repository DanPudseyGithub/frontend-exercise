This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It is styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and the API used is [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/docs).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
 
## Homework

Take some time to look through the existing application and identify things that can be improved:

- visual design
- user experience of the existing features (copy, interactions, etc.)
- performance
- accessibility (a11y)

Then, spend an hour or so implementing key improvements, in this order of priority:

1. make it work on mobile 
1. improve the look and feel
1. fix any UX quick wins 
1. fix any a11y quick wins
1. make code improvements

Do not attempt to implement any new features (ie. the shopping basket). It's not important that you finish any of this work, if you run out of time just make a note of the things you would do if you had more time.
